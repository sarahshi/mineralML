# ML4Minerals
The ML4Minerals Github repository contains several tools for cleaning data and for beginning to think about how we may best classify minerals in latent space (or potentially with other ML methods). 

ML_DataCleanup expands some existing functionalities within Thermobar to calculate representative ratios from raw data or cation sum. 

ML_Clustering compares various dimensionality reduction techniques for handling high-dimensionality data, from PCA to neural networks.
