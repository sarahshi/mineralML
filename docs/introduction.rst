Introduction and Citation
=========================

Welcome to ``MIN_ML``: An Open-Source Machine Learning Package for Probabilistically Classifying Minerals.

This tool is currently in progress, with submission to Volcanica in the near future. Please make sure you cite this tool if you use it. Software development takes time and and academia does not always recognize the effort taken, but it does recognize citations. 

The open-source nature of the tool allows for continuous development. We welcome the submission of high quality mineral analyses that can be added to the training dataset. You can email `sarah.shi@columbia.edu <mailto:sarah.shi@columbia.edu>`_ or post an enhancement request or report of a bug on the issue page of the `MIN_ML GitHub repository <https://github.com/SarahShi/MIN_ML>`_.
